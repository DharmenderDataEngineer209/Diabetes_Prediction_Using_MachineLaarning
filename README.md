## README: Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

    Project Overview
       This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements. Using Machine Learning, we process patient data, train a predictive model, and achieve
        reliable classifications between "Diabetic" and "Non-Diabetic" individuals.

    Why Machine Learning?
      Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. It is especially effective in analyzing
      complex datasets like medical diagnostics, where traditional methods may struggle to identify intricate patterns.

    Here, ML enables us to build a robust prediction model that supports early detection of diabetes, helping improve patient outcomes and resource allocation.

        Why StandardScaler?
             The StandardScaler is used to standardize the input data by scaling features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This normalization ensures that all features
             contribute equally to the model's performance, avoiding dominance by features with larger numerical ranges.

             In this project, the scaler enhances the accuracy and stability of the machine learning model, especially when applied to algorithms sensitive to data magnitudes, like Support
             Vector Machines (SVM).

        Why Support Vector Machine (SVM)?
             Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm effective for both classification and regression tasks. SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that
             separates data points of different classes with maximum margin.

        I chose SVM for this project because:

             Accuracy: SVM is highly accurate for binary classification problems like predicting diabetes.
             Versatility: It performs well on datasets where classes may not be linearly separable by utilizing kernel functions.
             Robustness: SVM handles noise and outliers effectively, making it suitable for medical data.


    Project Steps
         Data Collection: Collected diabetes data from a CSV file containing medical diagnostic features like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and insulin levels.
         Data Preprocessing:
             Standardized the data using StandardScaler to ensure uniform feature contribution.
             Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
         Model Training: Trained an SVM model on the preprocessed training data.
         Evaluation:
             Evaluated the modelâ€™s accuracy on both training and testing datasets using accuracy_score.
         Predictive System: Created a predictive system to classify a new input as "Diabetic" or "Non-Diabetic."
